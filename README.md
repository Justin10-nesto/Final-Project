# Final-Project
# PROJECT TITLE:
student learning platform based on knowledge and experience using artificial intelligence.

# PROJECT BACKGROUND INFORMATION
In Tanzania, Education sector is one among the sensitive sector that government take a look on third eye on taking all possible measures to ensure that all citizen got right to education and their able to reach their dreams that they think or the want to be though providing proper learning path from primary school up to university and curriculum for students to be covered on each level of education.
Current trends and challenges in education is that students experience low engagement and motivation to wards academic issues, lack of personalized learning, and difficulty in providing real-time feedback and guidance to students all occurs as a result of not using better AI techniques for promoting the students and in-depth analysis of student behavior, knowledge and experience in order to makegood recommendation to the students based on results obtained from analysis.
Due to advancement of technology, Machine learning can be used to analyze student data and behavior, improve content delivery and assessment, and adapt to student needs in real-time. Also, the role of big data and analytics, With the increasing availability of data on student learning and performance, AI-based systems can use this data to provide more accurate and effective personalized learning experiences.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The education sector in Tanzania plays a critical role in shaping individuals into competent professionals with both knowledge and moral values necessary for societal development. In order to acquire the required skills and knowledge, students must progress through a series of educational stages, starting from primary school and continuing through secondary school and university. The government has established a specific duration for each level of education, such as seven years for primary education and four years for secondary education.
However, the current system requires students to spend a minimum of one year at each level before being promoted to the next. This rigid structure can present challenges for students who are capable of covering the curriculum in a shorter timeframe. These students must wait until the next academic year to advance to the next level, resulting in time wastage and potential demotivation.
The prolonged duration at each level can be frustrating for students who have demonstrated sufficient knowledge and competency to progress further. It restricts their ability to advance at their own pace and hampers their educational journey. This issue hinders the educational system from fully catering to the needs and abilities of individual students.
Due to advancement of technology, Machine learning can be used to analyze student data and behavior, improve content delivery and assessment, and adapt to student needs in real-time. Also, the role of big data and analytics, With the increasing availability of data on student learning and performance, AI-based systems can use this data to provide more accurate and effective personalized learning experiences.

# OBJECTIVES
1. MAIN OBJECTIVE
The main objective is to develop system for student learning platform based on their knowledge and experience using AI.

2. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
i.	To develop subsystem for managing users.
ii.	To develop subsystem for online learning.
iii.	To develop subsystem for online examination using AI.
iv.	To develop subsystem for student recommendation based on their results.
v.	To develop sub system for student progress tracking and student promotion.
 
# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
i.	It will help students to move from one level to another faster based on its skills gained.
ii.	It helps student to know their areas of weakness and put more efforts.
iii. It helps to reduces some challenges that occurs in E-Learning that existence of high-level possibility of restricting illegitimate activities such as; cheating, plagiarism.
iv.	It helps to analyze the student results so that student can get recommendation based on their results.

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
This project is limited to subjects that do not contains complex mathematics, those subject student are able to performing their exams online and awarded a mark based on their answer. But subjects that contains mathematical methods system will no able to process the solution that student write due to fact that one question may have different methods of solving so it will be difficult for the system to award marks corrects instead the system will give the user questions of mathematics in multiple choice format then when user answer that question the system will compare the answer and one that found in the database then system will award a mark.
